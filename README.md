# Website for JustStreamIt

This project is part of my degree program at Openclassrooms (project 06: DÃ©veloppez une interface utilisateur pour une application web Python).

It will allow the subscribers of JustStreamIt to view interesting films in real-time. The website is written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Prerequisite

+ This project retrieves film data from a local version of the [OCMovies API](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR). One should run the API to 
test the project. To install the API and run the local server, please see the [documentation](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR#installation).

+ Download or clone this repository.

## Run the website

Open the index.html file at the project's root using a web browser while the OCMovies API server is running.
